## ECSE-427: Operating Systems

- These assignments were part of **ECSE-427** - Operating Systems Course at **McGill University**.
- Final Grade: **A**

### Assignment 1: **Shell Programming and Process Management**  
Focused on implementing a shell with enhanced commands for file and directory management, multi-command chaining, and process execution. Introduced process control mechanisms, batch mode operation, and foundational concepts in command interpretation and execution.

### Assignment 2: **Process Scheduling and Concurrency**  
Explored process scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin, with extensions like job aging for fairness. Transitioned from single-threaded to multi-threaded schedulers using `pthreads`, simulating multi-core environments and enabling concurrent process execution.

### Assignment 3: **Memory Management and Demand Paging**  
Covered memory management concepts such as demand paging, page tables, and the LRU page replacement policy. Enhanced the simulated OS to support execution of large programs by dynamically loading memory pages and efficiently handling page faults.
